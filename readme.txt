Provides comprehensive security during development by protecting your entire site and your admin pages from brute-force attacks.

== Description ==

This plugin empowers you to set up HTTP Authentication for your website. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a username and password to access specific areas.

Here's how it benefits you:

* **Enhanced Admin Security:** Shield your admin pages from brute-force attacks by adding a login barrier.
* **Controlled Crawling:** Restrict crawlers from accessing your site during development, preventing unnecessary indexing.
* **Post-Launch Access Control:** Maintain control over admin page access even after your website goes live.
* **Easy Activation/Deactivation:** Conveniently enable or disable HTTP Auth without deactivating the plugin entirely.
